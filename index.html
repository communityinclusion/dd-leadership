<p class="lead">If you’re a leader at a developmental disabilities (DD) organization here in Massachusetts, you’re seeing lots of change. People are retiring, and new professionals are taking their place. Significant changes in federal and state policies mean that you and your agency have to conform and perform. <strong>You must ensure that children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities are receiving the highest quality of services.</strong></p>

    <h4>So is there a way for you to not only stay on top of these changes, but also use them to empower your agency?</h4>

  <p><strong>Our new leadership and management certificate program will get you there.</strong></p>

  <p>The School for Global Inclusion and Social Development at UMass Boston and the Association of Developmental Disabilities Providers collaborated to create courses just for you. In fact, this is <strong>the only program</strong> specifically created for Massachusetts DD providers and leaders.</p>

  <p>Our curriculum applies research on executive management training, and integrates actual DD agency scenarios within each course. Instructors include employment experts from the Institute for Community Inclusion, as well as innovative DD managers from across the Commonwealth.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “What leadership has taught me is that one person cannot succeed alone. One person cannot be the leader and operate in isolation.”

    <cite>Gary Blumenthal, President & CEO, Association of Developmental Disabilities Providers
</cite>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
  Don’t get left behind. Lead the change to create the best results for your agency, your staff, and the individuals you serve.</p>

  <p>This <strong>hybrid course</strong> is a combination of in-person and online instruction. You’ll value both the convenience of the online format, and the personal connections built through our sessions on the UMass Boston campus.</p>

  <p>After completing the two 12-week sessions, you’ll get a non-credit certificate in contemporary practices in developmental disabilities leadership and management from UMass Boston.</p>

  <p>This course is rigorous and rewarding, and you’ll start putting what you learn into practice immediately.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “We’ve done a really great job as an industry moving services forward...There’s a lot more to do. In order
    to really keep that momentum going,
    we need certificate programs like this.”
    <cite>Brad Howell, CEO, Career Resources Corporation</cite>
  </blockquote>


  <p><strong>Some of the topics covered in our program are:</strong></p>

  <ul>
  <li>Values, legislation, and practices in the DD field</li>
  <li>Clarifying your agency’s mission and vision</li>
  <li>Understanding organizational culture to drive change</li>
  <li>Strategic planning--what it means, why it matters, how to do it</li>
